# DeSwap Protocol Interface using uniswap 

DeSwap is an open-source frontend interface for a decentralized exchange protocol. This project provides all the necessary components to interact with a decentralized liquidity protocol, allowing users to swap tokens, add or remove liquidity to pools, and manage their positions.

This interface is a fork of the original Uniswap V2 interface, providing a robust and well-tested foundation for decentralized trading.

## Features

-   **‚ÜîÔ∏è Token Swaps:** Seamlessly swap between a wide variety of ERC20 tokens. The interface automatically finds the best trading routes for optimal prices.
-   **üíß Liquidity Pools:** Add your tokens to liquidity pools to earn trading fees or remove your liquidity at any time.
-   **üìà V1 & V2 Support:** Includes functionality to interact with both V1 and V2 liquidity pools, along with tools to migrate V1 liquidity to V2.
-   **üîç Token Lists:** Supports community-curated token lists to easily find and import desired tokens, minimizing the risk of interacting with malicious contracts.
-   **üåê Wallet Integration:** Connects with a variety of wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic, and Portis using Web3-React.
-   **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Controls:** For experienced users, "Expert Mode" allows for higher slippage tolerance and custom transaction deadlines.
-   **üìä Transaction Management:** View your recent transaction history and track their status directly within the interface.
-   **üåç i18n Support:** Includes localization for multiple languages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (`>=10.0.0`)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   A Web3 wallet extension in your browser (e.g., MetaMask) configured for a testnet like Sepolia.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Pradise2/deswap.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the interface directory:**
    ```sh
    cd deswap/interface
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuring the Environment (Optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1.  In the `interface` directory, make a copy of `.env.production` and name it `.env.local`.
2.  Change `REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID` to your desired network ID (e.g., `"11155111"` for Sepolia).
3.  Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to your RPC endpoint (e.g., `"https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY"`).

## üìÇ Project Structure

The repository is structured as a monorepo containing two main packages:

-   `interface/`: The React-based frontend application that users interact with.
-   `v2sdk/`: The core SDK for programmatic interaction with the Uniswap V2 protocol smart contracts.
